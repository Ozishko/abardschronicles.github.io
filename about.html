<body>
<p> I am Ozan. My name literally means bard in my language, I am interested in folk music, music from the middle ages, blues, rock, classical, actually I like most genres of music, folk music has always been amazing to me, how a group of people create their own culture, and their own music based on their culture, the folklore is great. I love medieval music too, it is a pure type of music without drama in it, renaissence is the same. I love Owain Phyfe a lot, he is the one who inspired me. I play piano, guitar, harmonica, lyre(both plucked and bowed), citole, tin whistle and washboard.</p>
