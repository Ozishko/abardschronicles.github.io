<Title> Bard's Chronicles: An Archive to Fullfill Your Souls </Title>

<h2> Welcome to Bard's Chronicles, A Folk, Blues, Medieval, Renaissence, Classical Music, Story, and Poem archive. </h2>

<p> This website is an archive, where I share sheet music, lyrics, stories, poems and information about them. <p>

<p> I know this website is not even like a website, but I don't really have the money to pay for host, domain etc.<br> I am not accepting donations, at least for now because I don't pay anything but my time, I don't do this for money, I just want to make people realize how beautiful the music is.
